## Proposal exercise:
Write a research proposal, which can be your upcoming real master's thesis proposal or another topic of your choice; plus ethical considerations.


For sure you will have to write a proposal for your master’s thesis (now or later). Furthermore, both in academic research and in industrial practice, proposals are required if one wants to apply for funding for a project. The specific guidelines are, of course, very different, but all research proposals must more or less contain the following items, in an appropriate order:  

• Summarize the background and the state-of-the-art, witnessed by some key references.  
• Specify at least one clearly defined research question.  
• Motivate why the planned project is important at all. (For funding applications one can put it this way: Why should the financer give money for it?)  
• Argue why this is a significant step (and not only some routine work) and will increase the knowledge or the repository of methods in this field of work. Specify the scientific challenges.  
• Describe as clearly as possible what shall be done and accomplished. In particular: What problems exist, what are current solution methods, what are their limitations or drawbacks, etc.?  
• As far as possible, describe the approach(es) to be taken. In this way convince the reviewer that you have a clear idea of your project, and that it is manageable and realistic.  
• Also give delimitations: What is out of scope and will not be consid- ered in this work?
