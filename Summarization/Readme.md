## Summarization exercise:
Summarize an article or topic of your choice

1. First imagine an interested and intelligent layman. Explain on a high level what the subject is, and why it is important for others and for society. (The subject may have immediate applications, or it may contribute to a larger field of science being relevant for society – in any case, where do you see the connection?) In the case of historical articles also take the publication years into account, argue why the subject is still relevant, and what has changed since then. – This part should be about one A4 page long.

2. Then, for the main part imagine a reader that has a general CS background and mathematical skills, but has no deep knowledge of the particular subject. Explain the main concepts and contents. Make clear what problems are raised and how they are approached. Help the imagined reader to get into the subject. Your summary must be self-contained and comprehensible, and relevant key literature must be cited. Add details if they are enlightening, and as far as space allows. – The recommended length of your summary is about five A4 pages (excluding the bibliography). If you need more space, clearly mark the material beyond the space limit as Appendix. We can read appendices only superficially.
